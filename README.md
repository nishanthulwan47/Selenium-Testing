# Selenium-Testing
## The job for this assignment is to write a Selenium script that opens the page at http://localhost:8080/animal and then types in a value for each field and presses the submit button. It should submit the form 5 times and then write the conslusion message to the console. In a real test, we might attempt to do some validation, but for now we're just exploring Selenium and learning what it can do.
